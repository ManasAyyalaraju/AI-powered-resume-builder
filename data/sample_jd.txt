- Experience building and maintaining production-grade data pipelines and datasets that support BI and analytics
- Familiarity with at least one programming language for data (e.g., Python) and version control (e.g., Git)
- Strong communication and collaboration skills with both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Preferred Qualifications:
- 2–5 years of experience in analytics engineering, data engineering, or a closely related role
- Experience working with modern BI / visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Power BI, Tableau, Mode)
- Experience implementing and managing dbt projects (models, tests, documentation, CI/CD)
- Familiarity with orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Dagster, Prefect) and data pipeline monitoring
- Knowledge of software engineering best practices (code review, testing, CI/CD, modular design)
- Experience defining and governing business metrics across multiple teams
- Background in supporting stakeholders in product, marketing, growth, or finance
